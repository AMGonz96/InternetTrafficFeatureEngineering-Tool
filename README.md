# InternetTrafficFeatureEngineering-Tool

A script that can be used to engineer advanced features from live internet traffic extracted from Wireshark.

Feature engineering for various internet protocols in their associated connections has proven to be a difficult task, though some solutions have been developed there are few compatible for use directly with the python language. 

This script aims to generate unique internet traffic features with relevance to extracting features that could be most relevant to DDoS attack mitigation. 

Features for this script have been decided on based on popular and relevant academic papers in DDoS attack detection and mitigation.
